 3. My goal is to become a specialist in my field, I'm not trying to memorize, but to understand what I'm writing. I have no work experience in the field of IT, and no specialized education either. Last year, my husband suggested trying to write something in html, it was interesting and it was especially interesting to see the result, how the code turned into a website. After that we decided to deepen our knowledge and now I want to do front end as my main activity
4. I have no confident skills, I know a little html css js bootstrap and jquery.
